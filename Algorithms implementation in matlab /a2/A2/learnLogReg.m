% Inputs
%   x1  is an array of exemplars from class 1
%   x2  is an array of exemplars from class 2
%   alpha is an optional parameter for a weight decay regularizer
%
% Output
%   w  is a vector of estimated parameters for the logistic regressor
%   b  is the estimated bias term for the logistic regressor


%% TODO 1: 
%  Initialize the weights and bias.  The weights w are a vector whose dimension 
%  will depend on the dimension of each training exempla and the bias b is a scalar

w = zeros(size(x1, 1), 1);

% Set to zero if you're confident that they're correct and you want 
% to skip the check

%%%% data x1 and x2 from classes 1 and 2, and the weight vector w, 
%%%% and returns the negative log likelihood and the gradient of the
%%%% negative log likelihood.
%%%% Most of the code below can remain unchanged, up to the end of the inner
%%%% loop, but you should look at the code to make sure you understand it.
