1. The Data

This data set comes from a collection of 5000 personal email messages, 
1000 which are used for the training set, and 4000 for the test set.

Each spam message was reduced to 185 binary features. The text strings
associated with these 185 features are included in the "feature_names"
variables. Each message is thus represented by a vector of 185 binary
values, i.e., a row in the "data_train" and "data_train" vectors. Your
goal is to learn two classifiers that takes a 185-vector and returns a
class label. One classifier will use Logistic Regression, and one will
use Nai√Øve Bayes.

The "labels_test" and "labels_train" data sets are binary features
indicating which of the emails are spam and which are ham. We'll leave
it to you to figure out whether 0 or 1 indicates "spam." (Feel free to
discuss whether it's 0 or 1 on the online bulletin board.)

Thanks to Sam Roweis for providing this data.


2. MATLAB hints:

You can use the "find" command to separate the training sets, e.g.,
data_train(find(labels_train)==0,:) will give you all the data from
class 0.

You can use the 'sort' command to find the highest and lowest weights,
and then get the corresponding indices from the list of labels.
